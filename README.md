### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

As a Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience, I have consistently driven projects that deliver impactful results, particularly in enhancing application performance and customer satisfaction. 
My expertise in various software ecosystems and backend technologies has enabled me to lead initiatives that significantly improved application performance and drastically reduced query response times. These achievements are rooted in a deep understanding of customer needs and a focus on designing scalable, user-centric systems. I have taken full ownership of critical projects, overseeing them from inception to completion, and ensuring long-term value through strategic system overhauls, architecture improvements, and the implementation of best practices.

My work spans various industries, including but not limited to fintech, e-commerce, AI fields, where I have consistently maintained high standards, creating solutions that scale effectively to meet the highest demands. My ongoing pursuit of a Ph.D. in economics (trading) involving AI models underscores my commitment to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of technology. 
Throughout my career, I have built trust by consistently delivering results, leading cross-functional teams, and ensuring that my work aligns with both business objectives and customer needs, all while managing complex architectures designed to support high-volume, distributed systems.
