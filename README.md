### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

  As a highly skilled software engineer with over 5 years of experience, I specialize in PHP, JS ecosystem, Python and more (please refer to Skills section). I have a passion for innovative solutions and excel at building projects in various industries, including but not limited to fintech, e-commerce, education, social network.

I write clean, maintainable, and efficient code, employing best practices and design patterns. My expertise in Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and agile methodologies ensures timely delivery of top-quality work.

With fluency in English, Russian, Chinese, Turkish, Azerbaijani and mastery of Japanese in progress, I can communicate effectively with clients from diverse backgrounds and better understand their needs. My strong collaboration and communication skills facilitate effective project management with team members and stakeholders.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and excited to work with individuals who share my passion for innovation and excellence.
