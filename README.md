### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

  As a Senior Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience, I specialize in the JavaScript ecosystem, including, but not limited to Node.js, NestJS, Vue, React, Python, delivering impactful solutions across fintech, e-commerce, education, and more. My expertise in system architecture design, encompassing both web and mobile applications, ensures robust security and seamless integration.

I have consistently driven performance improvements, enhancing application efficiency and ensuring timely project completion. My work includes strategic overhauls for better system responsiveness and integrating APIs to expand platform capabilities. I emphasize best practices, including Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

In addition to backend and frontend development, I have significant experience in DevOps and database management, including relational, NoSQL, and time series databases, ensuring high standards of code quality and performance. My expertise in testing frameworks further supports the reliability of my work. I have also led successful technical recruitment initiatives, building cohesive, high-performing teams.

My academic background includes a Master's degree with research in the cryptocurrency field, and my forthcoming Ph.D. at Waseda University will focus on trading and AI models. Fluent in multiple languages, I effectively collaborate with clients from diverse backgrounds and stay current with industry trends. I am passionate about innovation and excellence.
